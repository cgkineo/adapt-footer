**Footer** can be configured at menu and page level.

## Settings overview

**Footer** attributes include a textarea for adding content and a class field for providing custom theme styles.

Some layout classes are pre-bundled:
**reverse-content-direction** : Content is positioned at the end of the container. By default, content is positioned at the beginning of the container.
**center-content** : Content is positioned at the center of the container.
**space-between-content** : Content is positioned with space between items.
**space-around-content** : Content is positioned with space before, between and after items.

Layout classes are based on css display flex properties.
